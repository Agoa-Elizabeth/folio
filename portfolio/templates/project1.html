      <h3>Karibu Groceries LTD Wholesale Produce Management System</h3>
      <h5>Project Overview:</h5>
      <p>
        Karibu Groceries LTD (KGL) is a wholesale distributor of cereals like
        Beans, Grain Maize, Cow Peas, G-nuts, and Soybeans, operating across two
        branches. Traditionally, KGL recorded all business operations manually
        using ruled black books, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of
        centralized tracking. To address these issues, I developed a
        comprehensive web-based management system tailored to KGL’s workflows.
        The platform digitizes procurement, stock tracking, sales (cash and
        credit), and role-based access for different user types — all aligned
        with the company's specific rules and operations.
      </p>

      <h2>How I Built It:</h2>
      <p><strong>Tech Used:</strong> Django, Bootstrap, SQLite, HTML, CSS</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML and CSS (with Bootstrap) for layout and
        styling. Forms and pages were built with Django’s templating engine,
        ensuring clean and responsive UI without relying on JavaScript.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Backend:</strong> Python with the Django framework was used to
        implement all business logic, manage views, and handle form submissions
        securely.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Database:</strong> Db.sqlite3 was used as the primary database
        to store structured data including users, procurement records, stock
        levels, sales entries, and credit sales.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Authentication:</strong> Implemented role-based access control
        using Django’s authentication system. User roles (Manager, Sales Agent,
        Director) are enforced throughout the system to ensure proper data
        access and control.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Data Validation:</strong> Used Django forms and model
        validations to enforce input rules such as valid phone numbers, national
        ID formats (NIN), numeric-only fields, and minimum character lengths.
      </p>

      The solution helped KGL move from outdated, error-prone manual systems to
      a digital workflow that improves accuracy, visibility, and
      decision-making. It enables the company to scale operations confidently
      and eliminates the bottlenecks caused by physical record-keeping.
